    <h1>Bounce - A Visual Basic project for a ball bouncing.</h1><br />

    <p>
        This project is an attempt to create the Sam Davis sample project from Chapter 8 of his Year 12 text for Software Design &amp; Development course. (NSW HSC syllabus, Australia).</p>
    Students are welcome to fork the project to date, but there are many more parts to complete.
    A little more is done each year when the project comes around.
